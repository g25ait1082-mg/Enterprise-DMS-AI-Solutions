📐 Enterprise DMS/SFA AI Architecture Guide
This architecture document describes the full-scale, enterprise-ready framework powering AI/ML-based Distribution Management System (DMS), Sales Force Automation (SFA), and analytics solutions as implemented in this repository.

1. Solution Context & Overview
Integrations:

Data: SAP ERP, Salesforce (SFA/CRM), Mobile Apps, External Data

ETL/Data Lake pipelines aggregate and cleanse all operational datasets

Feature Store keeps real-time engineered features for ML

AI Models: Demand Forecasting (LSTM), Next Best Action, Distributor Analytics, Inventory Optimization

Serving: APIs via AzureML/AWS SageMaker/Docker

BI: Dashboards in Power BI/Tableau

2. Component Design
Data Engineering: ETL, feature engineering, anomaly detection

ML/AI Stack: Demand forecasting, NBA recommendations, analytics, inventory optimization

Model Serving: APIs for real-time/batch inference (SFA, DMS, ERP, field apps)

Business Intelligence: Executable KPIs in Power BI/Tableau for leadership

MLOps: Training, deployment, monitoring with MLflow, CI/CD

3. Security, Compliance, Scalability
RBAC via Azure AD/OAuth

GDPR/DPDP compliance, PII masking

Kubernetes for scaling, disaster recovery, multi-region redundancy

4. Deployment Strategy
Dev/Test/Prod split via Terraform/Bicep, Docker, Kubernetes

Automated CI/CD for reliable releases

5. Integration Patterns
SAP OData Sync

Salesforce CRM & SFA Lead/Opportunity APIs

REST/GraphQL API for mobile and dashboards

6. Observability & Business Continuity
99.9% SLA on endpoints, automated failover

Centralized logs (Elastic/Azure Monitor)

Usage analytics, experiment tracking (MLflow)

7. Repository Use Case Mapping
Demand Forecasting: Stock planning, allocation, finance

NBA Engine: Real-time distributor recommendations, inventory actions

Distributor Analytics: Automated scoring, segmentation, churn, growth

Inventory Optimization: Multi-warehouse, reorder, stockout alerts

SFA Automation: Lead/opportunity scoring, territory optimization

8. Glossary
DMS: Distributor Management System

SFA: Sales Force Automation

NBA: Next Best Action

MLOps: Machine Learning Operations
